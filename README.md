solutions &amp; attempts at common algorithms questions 

Please consider this as a 'living document' while author attempts & learns variety of algo questions.

Maybe I get some things wrong or submit suboptimal solutions... part of the enjoyment is moving through an initial naive attempt (sometimes good enough) and if stumped, learning the technique.
